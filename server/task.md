#test assignment

Make a todo web application with backend and frontend.

use technologies:
- Node.Js
- MongoDB ( you can use Mysql or postgresql if you want. But MongoDB is preferred)
- Any frontend framework you like (VueJs is is preferred.  ) 
- upload source code to github
- Comprehensive instruction how the app works and how to deploy it
- backend should only be a rest API and front end only uses the backend API

Features:
- Create/delete/update todo
- set todo to "Done"
- reorder tasks
- show dates when todo was created
- Simple UI

Nice to have:
- login functionality (no need for admin panel. It is enough to have some built in user)
- nested tasks. (Big task can have multiple sub-tasks)
- quick entry. A text field when a text is written and hit "Enter" a new task is created
- Anything you would like to add
